<ul>
<li>What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
this.
</li>
<ol>
<li>Prioritization of Tasks: The first step is to assess the urgency and impact of each task. In this scenario, there are two tasks: Task 1 (for a low-priority customer without a specific go-live date) and Task 2 (for a priority customer with an imminent campaign).
The strategy is to prioritize Task 2 due to its time sensitivity and the potential impact on the customer's campaign.
</li>
<li>Immediate Focus on Task 2 (Priority Customer): The approach is to allocate immediate attention and resources to Task 2, which is for the priority customer.</li>
<li>Transparent Communication with Account Managers: To keep stakeholders informed and aligned, it's crucial to communicate the situation with the respective account managers and to explain the situation and the plan to address it.
These messages should convey a commitment to meet the campaign's deadline and an intention to allocate resources to Task 1 once Task 2 is under control.
</li>
<li>Extension Request for Task 1 (Low-Priority Customer): For Task 1, which is for a low-priority customer without a specific go-live date, the approach is to request an extension of 3 more days to complete the task.
The extension request should be made through clear and respectful communication, explaining the reason for the delay and emphasizing the commitment to quality.
</li>
<li>Resource Allocation and Task Sequencing: The strategy includes sequencing the tasks in a way that minimizes disruption to the priority task (Task 2).</li>
<li>Ongoing Monitoring and Communication: Throughout the process, it's important to monitor the progress of Task 2 and ensure that it remains on track for timely completion.
Regular communication with both account managers and the priority customer is essential to keep informed of progress and any changes in the situation.
</li>
<li>Contingency Planning: As part of the approach, contingency plans should be considered in case the situation worsens or if additional delays are anticipated beyond the initial 3-day extension.</li>
</ol>
<li>How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.</li>

<p>Subject: Task 1 - Project Delay and Extension Request<p>
<p>Hi Manoj,</p>
<p>I hope you're doing well. I wanted to inform you that due to a family emergency, I won't be able to meet the original due date for Task 1, which is for our low-priority customer. However, this customer hasn't provided a specific go-live date, so I plan to prioritize Task 2, which is for our priority customer with an impending campaign. Once Task 2 is under control, I'll allocate my resources to complete Task 1 within an additional 3 days.</p>
<p>I'll ensure that we maintain open communication with the customer and inform them about the delay.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any concerns or if there's anything specific, you'd like me to do during this period.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards, </p>
<p>Abdul Rahim Laskar</p>

<p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>I hope you're well. I wanted to inform you that I'm working diligently on Task 2, which is for our priority customer. Despite a family emergency, I'm committed to meeting the original due date for this task, which is crucial for the campaign's success. Once Task 2 is complete, I'll allocate my resources to Task 1, which is for our low-priority customer.</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated on the progress and will ensure that we meet the campaign's go-live requirements.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>Best regards, </p>
